<details><summary>Get AWS access from CloudTamer</summary>

1. login at [CloudTamer](https://cloudtamer.cms.gov)
2. Go to the [projects page](https://cloudtamer.cms.gov/portal/project)
3. access `wdsops-dev` by clicking on the cloud icon.
4. select `Cloud Access Roles`
5. select `wdsops-developer-admin` role
6. first click on `Web Access` to open AWS in another tab
7. navigate back to the CloudTamer browser tab and follow steps 3-5 again. 
8. now click on `Short-term Access Keys`. This will show temporary AWS keys.
9. Select the tab for your OS and follow option 1 then paste the copied export lines into your terminal.
10. You are all set, let's get started üòé

You now have a AWS Management console open and a terminal with AWS keys available.

Make sure to use this same terminal when running commands. The exported AWS keys will not apply to new terminals and will need to be reexported if a new session is started.

The best way to familiarize yourself with Fargate is to get some real experience with it.

While the modules involved in Fargate are in an early state there is enough to get a basic example deployed.

1. navigate your terminal to this file directory.
2. run `terraform init`
3. (replace `YOUR_FIRST_NAME_HERE` with your first name then) run `terraform apply -var "name=YOUR_FIRST_NAME_HERE"`
<details><summary>4. take a look at the resources that will be created. Here is a full list of what will be created:</summary>

# üó∫Ô∏è Explore 
We now have a Fargate environment bootstrapped.

Currently no tasks are running since no task definitions have been written.

Writing tasks will be handled by a Python deploy script.


### üè∫ History
Previously deploying resources was done using a Go script called [Deployer](https://github.com/CMSgov/deployer).

After personally doing an investigation on the Deployer I would consider it a massive success. 

> [pdf](https://jira.cms.gov/secure/attachment/1144434/Deployer.pdf) of my presentation on Deployer 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oddballteam/ecs-guide/main/img/overview.jpg" width=40%>

App teams have all successfully been able to interface with it using ops pipelines. 

Part of the magic that makes deployer a great tool is that it **abstracts** away many of the complexities. 

I was surprised to find that the vast majority of app teams members have no understanding of how the tool works (besides the top level input) despite it being in use for the last 6 years.

I found that there was 3 layers which led to the success of Deployer. 

![layers](/img/layers.jpg)
<!-- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oddballteam/ecs-guide/main/img/overview.jpg" width=80%> -->

- The App layer, this is where App teams would use ops pipelines run jobs
  - For investigating Deployer I worked with the API team. They have amazing examples of [pipelines](https://github.cms.gov/CMS-WDS/marketplace-api/tree/master/ops/jobs/deploy) which perfectly illustrate good abstraction. You can see these jobs only take the input of a `version` identifier. For example the current prod deploy is of version `r253`. So if I were to deploy to production I would run the `deploy-to-prod` job in Jenkins. For the version input I would provide `r254` and run the job (API team does require a checkbox to acknowledge prod deploys). That's it! This will do all the work of creating an AMI and replacing resources. The key to understand here is that deploys are dead simple.
- The Config layer, Deployer used a rarely updated (few times a year) file which houses some configuration data which will vary between teams. 
  - For Deployer this is something called a universe file stored in S3. An example of this can be seen in [app3](https://github.cms.gov/CMS-WDS/application/blob/master/ops/terraform/environments/env-shared/files/universe.json). Most of the file contains networking, security or log identifiers. These identifiers are important configuration which cannot be baked into the source code but also are not changed enough to be something defined at the app layer.
- The Source layer, the underlying script code. This does all the heavy lifting of deploying resources in the background
  - This should be built in a way which is as dynamic as possible. Meaning that anything which could change should be built to be able to be changed. This allows every team to be able to use the same underlying infrastructure and less duplication of code. This entails complexity but provides great benefits.



# üßπ Cleanup 

1. run `terraform destroy`
2. enter `yes` to destroy the resources
3. Manually delete ECR and S3 using the CLI

> Terraform cannot delete ECR if there is at least one image present, use the CLI instead
```sh
REPO=YOUR_REPO_NAME

aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name $REPO --force
```

> Terraform cannot delete buckets that are not empty, use the CLI to empty and delete them.
```sh
BUCKET=YOUR_BUCKET_NAME

aws s3api delete-objects --bucket $BUCKET \
  --delete "$(aws s3api list-object-versions \
  --bucket $BUCKET \
  --query='{Objects: Versions[].{Key:Key,VersionId:VersionId}}')"
  
aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket $BUCKET
```

4. Verify that everything has been cleaned up by running `terraform refresh` and a `terraform state list`. This should show an output similar to this:

> Since every line contains a `data` section these are not _real_ resources. You can read more about data sources from the [terraform docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources)
```
