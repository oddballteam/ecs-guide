# An engineer's guide to ECS
Welcome, to get started go ahead and clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/oddballteam/ecs-guide.git`

I can recommend viewing the guide in one of two ways:

- Browser: go [here](https://github.com/oddballteam/ecs-guide/blob/main/ecs/1%20Intro.md) and start reading.
- VS Code: you can preview markdown in VS Code which makes it much more readable. To do this you can either
  - use a hotkey (Windows) `ctrl + shift + v` (Mac)  `â‡§âŒ˜V`
  - right click on the file name at the top and click `Open Preview`

#### ðŸš©Ran into an issue?
